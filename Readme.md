Ollama Function Calling Collection

Welcome to the Ollama Function Calling Collection, a repository showcasing a growing set of tools and functionalities designed for integration with Ollama models. This collection highlights how to leverage function calls to enable real-world applications using AI-driven decision-making.

Current Files

1. Home Automation

This file demonstrates an AI-powered home automation simulation using function calling with Ollama models. It includes:
	•	Room Lighting Control: Functions to turn on or off lights in specific rooms.
	•	Temperature Setting: Function to set the temperature for a given room.
	•	Streamlit UI: An interactive interface to input commands and visualize the state of the apartment.

Key Features:
	•	Real-time decision-making by an LLM, using tools like turn_on_light, turn_off_light, and set_temperature.
	•	Translation and formatting capabilities to adapt non-English input or multi-word room names.
	•	Visual representation of room states, including light and temperature, in a simulated apartment layout.

Future Plans

This repository is a work in progress, with plans to expand the collection with additional functionalities across various domains. Upcoming files may include:
	•	Advanced Device Control: Manage more complex home automation devices like smart TVs or security systems.
	•	Dynamic Tool Registration: Enabling runtime addition of new tools for greater adaptability.
	•	Customizable Workflows: Allowing users to define their own automation scenarios.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to enhance this repository with practical and impactful AI-powered solutions.
